## Hello and welcome — I'm Brad Nelson

**Data Scientist | Senior Analyst | Builder of Solutions That Move Businesses Forward**  
Boston, MA  

I’m someone who has worked ten times harder than I had to just to get where I am — and I wouldn’t change a thing.  
I thrive when the path forward isn’t obvious: leading a project I’ve never tackled before, solving a problem no one knows how to approach, or answering a question that hasn’t been asked yet. That’s when I do my best work.

What motivates me is simple:  
I love real challenges. I love building clarity out of ambiguity. **And I love knowing I made the business measurably better.**

With 9+ years of experience in analytics, revenue-cycle optimization, and data science projects, I bring something rare to technical roles:  
the ability to translate between business, engineering, and leadership stakeholders — and deliver solutions that actually get used.

My background in operations management (stats-heavy), data science, and process optimization gives me the technical foundation to solve hard problems.  
My communication skills and leadership experience ensure those solutions create real impact.

I also recently earned my Six Sigma Yellow Belt — improving systems, reducing waste, and creating measurable value is part of how I think.
